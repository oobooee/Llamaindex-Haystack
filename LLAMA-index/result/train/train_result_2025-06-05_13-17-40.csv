## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.
* Inference layer: Softmax, CRF.","Summarize the following extracted text from a GitHub repository README into a concise term/phrase introducing the repository.

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

Consul provides several key features:

* Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.

* Service Mesh - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.

* API Gateway - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, allowing users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.

* Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.

* Dynamic App Configuration - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul, for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

Consul runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows.","Summarize the following extracted text from a GitHub repository README into a short term/phrase introducing the repository.

There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online uses either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.\n\nCountless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.\n\n### Features\n\n- Safe, Transparent and Open-Source\n- Plug and Play via USB. No hassles, easy and instant connection.\n- Select between Internal Memory and SD Card\n- Transfer multiple files which are larger than 4GB\n- Dark mode\n- Drag-and-drop support\n- Split pane views for both Local Computer and Android device\n- Choose between Grid and List view.\n- Use Keyboard Shortcuts to navigate through your files.\n- No collection of personally identifiable information.\n\n### Kalam Kernel\n\nOpenMTP 3.0 features a new MTP kernel and it was written from the scratch. It promises a file copy speed of 30 to 40 MB/s on low and mid range devices and 100 to 120 MB/s on higher end devices. The all new and powerful MTP kernel is named after [Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam)\n\nDo checkout the Go package which Ive written to build Kalam Kernel: [github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx). Feel free to raise PRs.\n\n### System Requirements and Support\n\n- To support macOS version below Big Sur the Kalam kernel needs to be compiled on an older macOS machine everytime there is an update, which is practically very difficult\n- Only the latest 3 versions of macOS will receive the  Kernel updates, which includes new device supports, fixes, stability improvements. macOS Big Sur (11.0) or above will receive the above said updates\n- We have now officially retired the support for  Kernel on macOS 10.13 (OS X El High Sierra) and lower. Only the ""Legacy"" MTP mode will continue working on these outdated machines.\n- We will continue releasing the updates for both  and  machines\n\n### Installation\n\n- Download the [Mac Apple Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=arm64 Mac Apple Silicon) version\n- Download the [Mac Intel Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=x64 Mac Intel Silicon) version\n- Using Homebrew Cask\n\n\n\n- Find the latest dmg file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/releases GitHub Releases)\n\n### Screengrabs\n\n![OpenMTP File Explorer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-explorer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Explorer)\n\n![OpenMTP File Transfer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-transfer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Transfer)\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n| Command                                           | Keyboard Shortcut                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Delete                                            | backspace                                                         |\n| New Folder                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+n                                          |\n| Copy                                              | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+c                                          |\n| Copy to Queue                                     | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+shift+c                         |\n| Paste                                             | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+v                                          |\n| Refresh                                           | command (\xe2\x8c\x98) +r                                         |\n| Folder Up                                         | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+b                                          |\n| Select All                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+a                                          |\n| Rename                                            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+d                                          |\n| Switch Tab                                        | command(\xe2\x8c\x98)+1                                           |\n| Open                                              | enter                                                             |\n| Navigate Left                                     | left                                                              |\n| Navigate Right                                    | right                                                             |\n| Navigate Up                                       | up                                                                |\n| Navigate Down                                     | down                                                              |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in Grid View)  | shift+left                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in Grid View) | shift+right                                            |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in List View)  | shift+up                                               |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in List View) | shift+down                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items (with mouse)            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+click or shift+click |\n\n## Building from Source\n\nRequirements: [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ Install Node.js v16), [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Install Git) and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ Install Yarn package manager)\n\n### Clone\n\n\n\n\n\n### Run\n\nA fresh clone might throw undefined state error.

## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.
* Inference layer: Softmax, CRF.","

## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.

## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

4,4,"# NCRF++: An Open-source Neural Sequence Labeling Toolkit

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.

Consul provides several key features:

* Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.

* Service Mesh - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.

* API Gateway - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, allowing users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.

* Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

* Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.

* Dynamic App Configuration - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul, for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.

## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online use either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

## Introduction

Sequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning-based feature extractor in sequence labeling tasks. CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Features within words are also useful for representation, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structures or human-defined neural features.

NCRF++ is a PyTorch-based framework with flexible choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of a famous statistical CRF framework.

This framework has been accepted as a demonstration paper, and the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted as the best paper.

NCRF++ supports different structure combinations on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation, and inference layer.

* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN, and handcrafted word features.
* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.
* Inference layer: Softmax, CRF.","
