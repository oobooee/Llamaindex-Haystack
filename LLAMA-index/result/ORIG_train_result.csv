## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online uses either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.","

So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.\n\n### Features\n\n- Safe, Transparent and Open-Source\n- Plug and Play via USB. No hassles, easy and instant connection.\n- Select between Internal Memory and SD Card\n- Transfer multiple files which are larger than 4GB\n- Dark mode\n- Drag-and-drop support\n- Split pane views for both Local Computer and Android device\n- Choose between Grid and List view.\n- Use Keyboard Shortcuts to navigate through your files.\n- No collection of personally identifiable information.\n\n### Kalam Kernel\n\nOpenMTP 3.0 features a new MTP kernel and it was written from the scratch. It promises a file copy speed of 30 to 40 MB/s on low and mid range devices and 100 to 120 MB/s on higher end devices. The all new and powerful MTP kernel is named after [Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam)\n\nDo checkout the Go package which Ive written to build Kalam Kernel: [github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx). Feel free to raise PRs.\n\n### System Requirements and Support\n\n- To support macOS version below Big Sur the Kalam kernel needs to be compiled on an older macOS machine everytime there is an update, which is practically very difficult\n- Only the latest 3 versions of macOS will receive the  Kernel updates, which includes new device supports, fixes, stability improvements. macOS Big Sur (11.0) or above will receive the above said updates\n- We have now officially retired the support for  Kernel on macOS 10.13 (OS X El High Sierra) and lower. Only the ""Legacy"" MTP mode will continue working on these outdated machines.\n- We will continue releasing the updates for both  and  machines\n\n### Installation\n\n- Download the [Mac Apple Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=arm64 Mac Apple Silicon) version\n- Download the [Mac Intel Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=x64 Mac Intel Silicon) version\n- Using Homebrew Cask\n\n\n\n- Find the latest dmg file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/releases GitHub Releases)\n\n### Screengrabs\n\n![OpenMTP File Explorer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-explorer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Explorer)\n\n![OpenMTP File Transfer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-transfer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Transfer)\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n| Command                                           | Keyboard Shortcut                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Delete                                            | backspace                                                         |\n| New Folder                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+n                                          |\n| Copy                                              | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+c                                          |\n| Copy to Queue                                     | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+shift+c                         |\n| Paste                                             | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+v                                          |\n| Refresh                                           | command (\xe2\x8c\x98) +r                                         |\n| Folder Up                                         | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+b                                          |\n| Select All                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+a                                          |\n| Rename                                            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+d                                          |\n| Switch Tab                                        | command(\xe2\x8c\x98)+1                                           |\n| Open                                              | enter                                                             |\n| Navigate Left                                     | left                                                              |\n| Navigate Right                                    | right                                                             |\n| Navigate Up                                       | up                                                                |\n| Navigate Down                                     | down                                                              |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in Grid View)  | shift+left                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in Grid View) | shift+right                                            |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in List View)  | shift+up                                               |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in List View) | shift+down                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items (with mouse)            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+click or shift+click |\n\n## Building from Source\n\nRequirements: [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ Install Node.js v16), [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Install Git) and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ Install Yarn package manager)\n\n### Clone\n\n\n\n\n\n### Run\n\nA fresh clone might throw undefined state error.
