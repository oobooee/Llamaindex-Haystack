Summarize the following extracted text from a Github repository README into a concise term/phrase that introduces the repository. Prioritize using any tagline, functional description, or purpose statement present at the beginning of the text. Ensure to capture key components, functionalities, and examples of tasks the toolkit can be used for, such as NER, POS tagging, or segmentation. Highlight the toolkit's ease of use, configurability, and mention any specific neural network components like character LSTM/CNN, word LSTM/CNN, and inference layers like Softmax/CRF. Focus on including the toolkit's name and its primary purpose or functionality. The output should be a short term/phrase that directly reflects the initial description if present and effectively captures the essence of the toolkit.
