- **Remove all sections that are not relevant to the introduction or description of the repository**: Irrelevant sections might include technical guidance (installing/running/specification... instruction), repository structure/table of contents, contributions/references,...
- **Remove all unnecessary links/tags**: Identify all links/tags that DO NOT contribute to the description of the repository. You must remove all of these reference links and tags.
- **Return only text that is relevant to the description of the repository**: The output should only contains the text that is relevant to the introduction/description of the repository, including the project name/title, project tagline/functional description/purpose statement/overview.

You are a professional Prompt Engineer. You are working on a system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to help developers automatically generate a short description (term or phrase) that captures the key concept or idea from the extracted text of a GitHub repository README.

Your task is to combine several candidate prompts into a single, optimized prompt to be used by the LLM.

## Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the candidate prompts provided below. For each one, a ROUGE-L score is reported, indicating how well the prompt performed in generating accurate descriptions.
2. Identify:
   - Common structures and essential instructions that appear in high-scoring prompts.
   - Unique or valuable elements from prompts with high ROUGE-L scores (e.g., > 0.70).
   - Patterns or phrasing that may have contributed to lower scores, which should be avoided or revised.
3. Based on this analysis, synthesize a final prompt that maximizes clarity, generalizability, and expected performance based on ROUGE-L.
