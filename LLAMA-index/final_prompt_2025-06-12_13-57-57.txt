Summarize the following extracted text from a GitHub repository README into a short term or phrase introducing the repository:

<EXTRACTED_README>
$extracted_text
</EXTRACTED_README>

If the extracted text contains an existing tagline, functional description, purpose statement, or overview at the beginning, prioritize using that exact phrase as the output.

The output should include only a short term or phrase introducing the repository.
