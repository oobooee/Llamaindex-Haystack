OpenMTP  - Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS,"b'# OpenMTP | Android File Transfer for macOS\n\n- Author: [Ganesh Rathinavel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ganeshrvel Ganesh Rathinavel)\n- License: [MIT](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/blob/master/LICENSE MIT)\n- System Requirements: macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or higher\n- Website URL: [https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/ https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com)\n- Repo URL: [https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/ https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp)\n- Contacts: ganeshrvel@outlook.com\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.\n\nTransferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official ""Android File Transfer"" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP devices. Most of the other apps available online uses either WiFi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.\n\nCountless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.\n\n### Features\n\n- Safe, Transparent and Open-Source\n- Plug and Play via USB. No hassles, easy and instant connection.\n- Select between Internal Memory and SD Card\n- Transfer multiple files which are larger than 4GB\n- Dark mode\n- Drag-and-drop support\n- Split pane views for both Local Computer and Android device\n- Choose between Grid and List view.\n- Use Keyboard Shortcuts to navigate through your files.\n- No collection of personally identifiable information.\n\n### Kalam Kernel\n\nOpenMTP 3.0 features a new MTP kernel and it was written from the scratch. It promises a file copy speed of 30 to 40 MB/s on low and mid range devices and 100 to 120 MB/s on higher end devices. The all new and powerful MTP kernel is named after [Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam)\n\nDo checkout the Go package which Ive written to build Kalam Kernel: [github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx). Feel free to raise PRs.\n\n### System Requirements and Support\n\n- To support macOS version below Big Sur the Kalam kernel needs to be compiled on an older macOS machine everytime there is an update, which is practically very difficult\n- Only the latest 3 versions of macOS will receive the  Kernel updates, which includes new device supports, fixes, stability improvements. macOS Big Sur (11.0) or above will receive the above said updates\n- We have now officially retired the support for  Kernel on macOS 10.13 (OS X El High Sierra) and lower. Only the ""Legacy"" MTP mode will continue working on these outdated machines.\n- We will continue releasing the updates for both  and  machines\n\n### Installation\n\n- Download the [Mac Apple Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=arm64 Mac Apple Silicon) version\n- Download the [Mac Intel Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=x64 Mac Intel Silicon) version\n- Using Homebrew Cask\n\n\n\n- Find the latest dmg file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/releases GitHub Releases)\n\n### Screengrabs\n\n![OpenMTP File Explorer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-explorer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Explorer)\n\n![OpenMTP File Transfer](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/raw/master/blobs/images/file-transfer-bluebg.jpg OpenMTP File Transfer)\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n| Command                                           | Keyboard Shortcut                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Delete                                            | backspace                                                         |\n| New Folder                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+n                                          |\n| Copy                                              | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+c                                          |\n| Copy to Queue                                     | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+shift+c                         |\n| Paste                                             | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+v                                          |\n| Refresh                                           | command (\xe2\x8c\x98) +r                                         |\n| Folder Up                                         | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+b                                          |\n| Select All                                        | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+a                                          |\n| Rename                                            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+d                                          |\n| Switch Tab                                        | command(\xe2\x8c\x98)+1                                           |\n| Open                                              | enter                                                             |\n| Navigate Left                                     | left                                                              |\n| Navigate Right                                    | right                                                             |\n| Navigate Up                                       | up                                                                |\n| Navigate Down                                     | down                                                              |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in Grid View)  | shift+left                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in Grid View) | shift+right                                            |\n| Select Multiple Items Forward (in List View)  | shift+up                                               |\n| Select Multiple Items Backward (in List View) | shift+down                                             |\n| Select Multiple Items (with mouse)            | command (\xe2\x8c\x98)+click or shift+click |\n\n## Building from Source\n\nRequirements: [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ Install Node.js v16), [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Install Git) and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ Install Yarn package manager)\n\n### Clone\n\n\n\n\n\n### Run\n\nA fresh clone might throw undefined state error.

"NCRF++, a Neural Sequence Labeling Toolkit. Easy use to any sequence labeling tasks (e.g. NER, POS, Segmentation). It includes character LSTM/CNN, word LSTM/CNN and softmax/CRF components. ","b'\n\n\n# NCRF++: An Open-source Neural Sequence Labeling Toolkit\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Introduction\n\nSequence labeling models are quite popular in many NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and word segmentation. State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning based feature extractor in sequence labeling task. And CNN can also be used due to faster computation. Besides, features within word are also useful to represent word, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structure or human-defined neural features.\n\nNCRF++ is a PyTorch based framework with flexiable choices of input features and output structures. The design of neural sequence labeling models with NCRF++ is fully configurable through a configuration file, which does not require any code work. NCRF++ can be regarded as a neural network version of , which is a famous statistical CRF framework. \n\nThis framework has been accepted by  as demonstration paper. And the detailed experiment report and analysis using NCRF++ has been accepted at  as the best paper.\n\nNCRF++ supports different structure combinations of on three levels: character sequence representation, word sequence representation and inference layer.\n\n* Character sequence representation: character LSTM, character GRU, character CNN and handcrafted word features.\n* Word sequence representation: word LSTM, word GRU, word CNN.\n* Inference layer: Softmax, CRF.\n\nWelcome to star this repository!\n\n## Requirement\n\n\tPython: 2 or 3  \n\tPyTorch: 1.0 \n\n\n\n\n## Advantages\n\n* Fully configurable: all the neural model structures can be set with a configuration file.\n* State-of-the-art system performance: models build on NCRF++ can give comparable or better results compared with state-of-the-art models.\n* Flexible with features: user can define their own features and pretrained feature embeddings.\n* Fast running speed: NCRF++ utilizes fully batched operations, making the system efficient with the help of GPU (>1000sent/s for training and >2000sents/s for decoding).\n* N best output: NCRF++ support  decoding (with their probabilities).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nNCRF++ supports designing the neural network structure through a configuration file. The program can run in two status; [<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D81350>] and [<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D83090>]. (sample configuration and data have been included in this repository)  \n\nIn [<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D80450>] status:\n\n\nIn [<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D80290>] status:\n\n\nThe configuration file controls the network structure, I/O, training setting and hyperparameters. \n\n[<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D82D10>, <marko.inline.Link object at 0x000001F253D807D0>, <marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D83490>]\n\nNCRF++ is designed in three layers (shown below): character sequence layer; word sequence layer and inference layer. By using the configuration file, most of the state-of-the-art models can be easily replicated [<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D82F10>]. On the other hand, users can extend each layer by designing their own modules (for example, they may want to design their own neural structures other than CNN/LSTM/GRU). Our layer-wised design makes the module extension convenient, the instruction of module extension can be found .\n\n\n\n\n## Data Format\n\n* You can refer the data format in . \n* NCRF++ supports both BIO and BIOES(BMES) tag scheme.  \n* Notice that IOB format ([<marko.inline.RawText object at 0x000001F253D5D210>] from BIO) is currently not supported, because this tag scheme is old and works worse than other schemes . \n* The difference among these three tag schemes is explained in this .\n* I have written a  which converts the tag scheme among IOB/BIO/BIOES. Welcome to have a try. \n\n\n## Performance\n\nResults on CONLL 2003 English NER task are better or comparable with SOTA results with the same structures. \n\nCharLSTM+WordLSTM+CRF: 91.20 vs 90.94 of ;\n\nCharCNN+WordLSTM+CRF:  91.35 vs 91.21 of .   \n\nBy default,  is bidirectional LSTM.    \n\n|ID| Model | Nochar | CharLSTM |CharCNN   \n|---|--------- | --- | --- | ------    \n|1| WordLSTM | 88.57 | 90.84 | 90.73  \n|2| WordLSTM+CRF | 89.45 | 91.20 | 91.35 \n|3| WordCNN |  88.56| 90.46 | 90.30  \n|4| WordCNN+CRF |  88.90 | 90.70 | 90.43  \n\nWe have compared twelve neural sequence labeling models () on three benchmarks (POS, Chunking, NER) under statistical experiments, detail results and comparisons can be found in our COLING 2018 paper .\n \n\n## Add Handcrafted Features\n\nNCRF++ has integrated several SOTA neural characrter sequence feature extractors: CNN (), LSTM () and GRU (). In addition, handcrafted features have been proven important in sequence labeling tasks. NCRF++ allows users designing their own features such as Capitalization, POS tag or any other features (grey circles in above figure). Users can configure the self-defined features through configuration file (feature embedding size, pretrained feature embeddings .etc). The sample input data format is given at , which includes two human-defined features  and . ( and  are two examples, you can give your feature any name you want, just follow the format  and configure the feature with the same name in configuration file.)\nUser can configure each feature in configuration file by using \n\n\n\nFeature without pretrained embedding will be randomly initialized.\n\n\n## Speed\n\nNCRF++ is implemented using fully batched calculation, making it quite effcient on both model training and decoding. With the help of GPU (Nvidia GTX 1080) and large batch size, LSTMCRF model built with NCRF++ can reach 1000 sents/s and 2000sents/s on training and decoding status, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## N best Decoding\n\nTraditional CRF structure decodes only one label sequence with largest probabolities (i.e. 1-best output). While NCRF++ can give a large choice, it can decode  label sequences with the top  probabilities (i.e. n-best output). The nbest decodeing has been supported by several popular statistical CRF framework. However to the best of our knowledge, NCRF++ is the only and the first toolkit which support nbest decoding in neural CRF models. \n\nIn our implementation, when the nbest=10, CharCNN+WordLSTM+CRF model built in NCRF++ can give 97.47% oracle F1-value (F1 = 91.35% when nbest=1) on CoNLL 2003 NER task.\n\n\n\n\n## Reproduce Paper Results and Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nTo reproduce the results in our COLING 2018 paper, you only need to set the  as  in configuration file  and configure your file directory in this configuration file. The default configuration file describes the  model, you can build your own model by modifing the configuration accordingly. The parameters in this demo configuration file are the same in our paper. (Notice the  related models need slightly different parameters, details can be found in our COLING paper.)\n\nIf you want to use this framework in new tasks or datasets, here are some tuning  by @Victor0118.\n\n\n## Report Issue or Problem\n\nIf you want to report an issue or ask a problem, please attach the following materials if necessary.
